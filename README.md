# palindrome-checker
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

<h2>Question</h2>
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
.
We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.
We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.

<h2>Solution</h2>
We'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces, and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes
